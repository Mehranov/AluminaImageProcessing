# AluminaImageProcessing
We are looking to find hexagonal patterns in our SEM images of alumina and measure the porosity arrangement
You should Only run the MAIN.m file and then load your SEM imgae of alumina (with hexagonal patterns)
The you will be asked to input the number of eliminating neighbouring pixels (which can be a number between 1 to 4). Usually if the image is too big you will get the best result by chosing 4 and if the image is very small the 1 will give you a better results. (you can always run the program choosing different numbers to see which one works best)
Then the program will run automatically and detect all patterned pizxels
I have included two output samples (image files) to show how it looks like
